## 2a.How to create find the mean without using the "mean" function in R
### First, create your sequence to test.
```{r}
a = seq(from = 0, to = 100)
```
### Then, divide the sum of the numbers by the number count.
```{r}
avg = sum(a)/length(a)
avg
```
## 2b. How to solve a system of equations in R  
### Start off with making a matrix of the coefficients:  
```{r}
d <- matrix(c(2,5,1,3),nrow = 2, ncol = 2, byrow = TRUE)
d
```
### Then, enter your solutions into its own matrix: 
```{r}
a <- matrix(c(33,19), nrow = 2, ncol = 1, byrow = TRUE)
a
```
### Lastly, use the "solve" function by calling both objects: 
```{r}
solve(d,a)
```
## 2c. Installing a package:
```{r}
install.packages("dplyr")
```
## 2d. How to create a simple data frame in R:
### First, begin by setting up an object that is a data frame.
```{r}
a <- data.frame()
```
### Then, enter in a matrix with the concatanated desired values.
```{r}
a <- data.frame(matrix(c("A","B","C","D","D","E","F","G")))
```
### Lastly, enter in the number of rows and columns.
```{r}
a <- data.frame(matrix(c("A","B","C","D","D","E","F","G"), nrow = 2, ncol = 4, byrow = TRUE))
print(a)
```
